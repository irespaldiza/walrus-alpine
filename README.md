# Walrus
Walrus is my develop center in a Docker container. The name is inspired by Captain Flint's ship (Character of the *Treasure Island*, created by **Robert Louis Stevenson** in 1883)

It is designed to share a folder with our settings and resources. This image has installed Docker and docker compose so we can launch containers with different applications or programming languages. Vim is the default editor.
